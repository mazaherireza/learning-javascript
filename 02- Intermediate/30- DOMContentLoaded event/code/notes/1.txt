Document: DOMContentLoaded event
--------------------------------
... fires when the HTML document has been completely parsed, and all deferred scripts 
(<script defer src=""> and <script type="module">) have downloaded and executed.
It doesn't wait for other things like images, subframes, and async scripts to finish loading.

Checking whether loading is already complete
DOMContentLoaded may fire before your script has a chance to run,
so it is wise to check, before adding a listener.

if(document.readyState === "loading") {
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", doSomething)
}
