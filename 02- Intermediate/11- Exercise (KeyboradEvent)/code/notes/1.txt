JavaScript onKeyPress, onKeyUp and onKeyDown Events
---------------------------------------------------
Whenever a key is pressed or released, there are certain events that are triggered.
... in the following order:

keydown Event
... when the user "has pressed down" the key.
It will occur even if the key pressed does not produce a character value.

keypress Event
... when the user presses a key that produces a character value.

Modifier keys such as "Shift", "CapsLock", "Ctrl" etc. do not produce a character,
therefore they have no "keypress" event attached to them. <---------------------- ***

keyup event
... when the user has released the key.
It will occur even if the key released does not produce a character value.
