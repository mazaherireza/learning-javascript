document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  console.log("DOM fully loaded and parsed.");

/* DOMContentLoaded: Ideal for running JavaScript as soon as the DOM is ready,
  without waiting for all resources.

  onload: Perfect when your script needs every resource, like images, ... to be loaded.
