// * Note: Arrays in JavaScript can work both as a queue and as a stack. (... deque)

// Methods that work with the beginning of the array:
// shift <----------------- Extracts the first element of the array and returns it
// unshift <---------------- Add the element(s) to the beginning of the array

// An array is a special kind of object.
// ... it is copied by reference
// ... but what makes arrays really special is their internal representation.

// To be precise, it is actually not the count of values in the array, but the greatest numeric index plus one.

// So, the simplest way to clear the array is: arr.length = 0;.

// Arrays have their own implementation of toString method that returns a comma-separated list of elements.

// ... they implement only toString conversion.

// Don’t compare arrays with ==

// Arrays in JavaScript, unlike some other programming languages, shouldn’t be compared with operator ==.
// This operator has no special treatment for arrays, it works with them as with any objects.

// The strict comparison === is even simpler, as it doesn’t convert types.

// So, how to compare arrays?
// That’s simple: don’t use the == operator.
// Instead, compare them item - by - item in a loop or using iteration methods

// That’s because arrays are objects. So both shoppingCart and fruits are the references to the same array.

/*
The call arr[2]() is syntactically the good old obj[method](), in the role of obj we have arr, and in the role of method we have 2.
So we have a call of the function arr[2] as an object method. Naturally, it receives "this", referencing the object arr and outputs the array:
