document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
  console.log("DOM content loaded.");
});

// DOMContentLoaded: Ideal for running JavaScript as soon as the DOM is ready,
// without waiting for all resources.

// onload: Perfect when your script needs every resource, like images, ... to be loaded.
